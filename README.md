# ai_tutor
This Python script builds a question-answering system using LangChain and HuggingFace's models. The system loads a text document, splits it into manageable chunks, creates embeddings for those chunks, and uses a pre-trained language model to answer user queries interactively. Make a txt file and add your data in it.Add the file path in the code.
